## Understanding Unit Testing

Unit testing forms the foundation of our testing strategy because it allows us to verify individual components in isolation. Think of unit tests as examining each brick in a building separately before assembling the entire structure. This approach helps us:

- Identify bugs early in the development process
- Ensure that changes don't break existing functionality
- Document how components should behave
- Make refactoring safer by providing immediate feedback

In the context of our GUI application, unit tests focus on the application's internal logic rather than its visual presentation, ensuring that data processing, file handling, and business rules work correctly regardless of how they're presented in the interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, you'll need to set up your testing environment:

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-mock
```

These packages serve different but complementary roles:

- **pytest**: This testing framework simplifies test writing with its expressive syntax and powerful test discovery. It automatically finds and runs tests in files with names like `test_*.py`.
    
- **pytest-mock**: Built on top of Python's `unittest.mock`, this plugin makes it easier to replace real objects with test doubles, allowing us to test components in isolation without requiring actual file systems, network connections, or other external dependencies.
    

Make sure you're using the same virtual environment as your main application. If you've run `run.sh` or `run.bat`, you should already have this environment activated.

## Running Tests

All test commands should be run from the project's root directory (`/organise_dirs_front_end/`). Here are the most useful commands, with explanations of when you might want to use each one:

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

This command runs every test in the suite. It's useful for comprehensive verification before committing changes or preparing a release.

### Run Tests for a Specific Module

```bash
# Test the configuration management functionality
pytest tests/core/test_config_manager.py

# Test just the validation utilities
pytest tests/utils/test_validators.py
```

Use these focused commands when you're working on a specific component and want quick feedback on your changes.

### Run a Specific Test Class

```bash
# Run all tests related to preset management
pytest tests/core/test_preset_manager.py::TestPresetManager
```

This approach is helpful when you're interested in a particular area of functionality that's encapsulated in a test class.

### Run a Specific Test Function

```bash
# Test only the configuration loading success path
pytest tests/core/test_config_manager.py::test_load_config_success

# Test only the byte size formatting function
pytest tests/ui/test_results_tree_manager.py::TestResultsTreeManagerFormatSize::test_format_size_bytes
```

Running individual test functions is perfect for troubleshooting a specific issue or verifying a bug fix.

### Run Tests with Verbose Output

```bash
pytest -v tests/
```

The verbose flag provides detailed output showing the name and result of each individual test, which helps you understand exactly what's being tested and what might be failing.

### Stop on the First Failure

```bash
pytest -x tests/
```

When debugging complex issues, it's often more efficient to fix one problem at a time. This flag stops the test run after the first failure, letting you focus on fixing that specific issue before moving on.

### Measuring Test Coverage

To understand how much of your code is actually being tested:

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pytest --cov=organize_gui tests/
```

Coverage reports show you which lines of code are executed during tests and, more importantly, which ones aren't. This helps identify untested areas that might contain hidden bugs.

## Test Structure

Our test structure mirrors the application's architecture to make it easy to find tests for specific components:

```
tests/
├── core/           # Tests for core business logic
│   ├── test_config_manager.py
│   ├── test_duplicate_helpers.py
│   └── ...
├── ui/             # Tests for UI-related functionality
│   ├── test_rule_list_manager.py
│   └── ...
└── utils/          # Tests for utility functions
    ├── test_path_helpers.py
    └── ...
```

This organization makes it easier to:

- Find tests related to specific components
- Understand which parts of the application are well-tested
- Identify where new tests should be placed

## Testing Approach

Our testing philosophy emphasizes several key principles:

### Unit Testing

We focus on testing individual functions and methods in isolation. For example, when testing a function that calculates duplicate scores, we don't test the UI that displays those scores or the file system that provides the files—we test just the scoring logic.

This approach provides several benefits:

- **Faster tests**: Unit tests run quickly because they don't need to set up complex environments
- **Precise failure information**: When a test fails, you know exactly which component has an issue
- **Better code design**: Writing testable code naturally leads to better separation of concerns

### Focus on Logic, Not Presentation

We test what the code _does_, not how it _looks_. For instance:

```python
# We test this (logic):
def calculate_similarity_score(file1, file2):
    # Logic to compare files and return a score
    return score

# Rather than this (presentation):
def update_similarity_display(score):
    # Update UI with formatted score
    label.config(text=f"Similarity: {score:.2f}%")
```

This ensures that even if the UI changes, our core logic remains solid and testable.

### Mocking External Interactions

To keep tests reliable and fast, we use mocks to simulate external dependencies:

```python
def test_save_config(mocker):
    # Mock the file open operation
    mock_open = mocker.patch("builtins.open", mocker.mock_open())
    
    # Mock yaml.dump to avoid actually writing files
    mock_yaml_dump = mocker.patch("yaml.dump")
    
    # Test the function that would normally write to disk
    config_manager.save_config({"test": "data"})
    
    # Verify the function tried to open the correct file
    mock_open.assert_called_once_with("/expected/path/config.yaml", "w")
    
    # Verify the correct data was passed to yaml.dump
    mock_yaml_dump.assert_called_once_with({"test": "data"}, ANY)
```

This technique lets us test file operations without writing to disk, network requests without internet connectivity, and external libraries without their actual implementation.

### Parametrization for Thorough Testing

We use pytest's parametrize feature to test multiple scenarios efficiently:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("input_size,expected_output", [
    (1023, "1023 bytes"),
    (1024, "1.0 KB"),
    (1024 * 1024, "1.0 MB"),
    (1024 * 1024 * 1024, "1.0 GB"),
])
def test_format_size_bytes(input_size, expected_output):
    assert format_size_bytes(input_size) == expected_output
```

This approach tests multiple input/output pairs with a single test function, making our tests more comprehensive while keeping the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

## Test File Overview

Each test file has a specific focus. Understanding these files helps you navigate the test suite more effectively:

### Core Tests

- **`test_config_manager.py`**: Ensures our YAML configuration handling works correctly, including loading, saving, and updating configurations. These tests verify that paths are extracted properly and that configurations are stored in the expected format.
    
- **`test_duplicate_helpers.py`**: Tests the logic that identifies and scores file duplicates. These tests mock file metadata (like size, modification time, and content hashes) to verify our duplicate detection algorithms.
    
- **`test_organize_runner.py`**: Verifies that we correctly find and execute the `organize` script, manage temporary configurations, and handle process creation/termination. These tests mock `subprocess` to simulate command execution without actually running external processes.
    
- **`test_output_parser.py`**: Tests the parsing of console output from the external `organize-tool`. These tests ensure we correctly categorize actions (move, copy, rename, delete, echo, skipped) and identify errors in the output.
    
- **`test_preset_manager.py`**: Verifies that default configurations and presets are properly loaded and created. These tests check that our preset system provides sensible defaults and handles custom presets correctly.
    

### UI Tests

- **`test_rule_list_manager.py`**: Tests the logic that categorizes and manages rules, independent of how they're displayed in the UI. These tests focus on the data structures and algorithms that drive the rule list, not the visual presentation.
    
- **`test_results_tree_manager.py`**: Verifies helper functions like size formatting that support the results display. For example, tests ensure that file sizes are converted to human-readable formats correctly (e.g., converting bytes to KB, MB, GB).
    

### Utility Tests

- **`test_path_helpers.py`**: Tests functions that handle path expansion, environment variable substitution, and path formatting. These tests verify that paths are processed consistently across different operating systems.
    
- **`test_validators.py`**: Ensures that our validation logic correctly identifies valid and invalid inputs for paths, YAML syntax, rule names, and extension definitions. These tests help prevent input-related bugs.
    

## Writing New Tests

When adding new functionality to the application, always accompany it with tests. Here's a simple template for a test function:

```python
def test_new_feature():
    # 1. Set up any necessary test data
    input_data = {"key": "value"}
    
    # 2. Call the function being tested
    result = function_under_test(input_data)
    
    # 3. Verify the result meets expectations
    assert result == expected_output
    
    # 4. Verify any side effects (if applicable)
    mock_dependency.assert_called_once_with(expected_args)
```

Remember these principles when writing new tests:

- Each test should focus on a single behavior or feature
- Tests should be independent and not rely on the state from other tests
- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- Include tests for both successful operations and error handling

## Common Testing Patterns

These patterns appear frequently in our test suite and are worth understanding:

### Setup and Teardown

When tests need common setup or cleanup:

```python
class TestWithFixtures:
    def setup_method(self):
        # Code that runs before each test method
        self.temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    
    def teardown_method(self):
        # Cleanup code that runs after each test method
        shutil.rmtree(self.temp_dir)
        
    def test_something(self):
        # Test that uses self.temp_dir
```

### Testing Exceptions

When you need to verify that a function raises the right exception:

```python
def test_invalid_input_raises_value_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        validate_path("invalid:/path")
    
    # Optionally verify the exception message
    assert "Invalid path format" in str(excinfo.value)
```

### Testing Async Code

For testing asynchronous functions:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    result = await async_function_under_test()
    assert result == expected_value
```

## Limitations

It's important to understand what our current test suite does not cover:

- **No GUI Interaction Tests**: These tests don't click buttons or fill in forms. They verify the underlying logic, not the user interface flow.
    
- **No Visual Verification**: Layout, styling, and visual appearance aren't tested.
    
- **No Performance Testing**: While the tests verify correctness, they don't measure or ensure performance under load.
    

For complete application testing, these unit tests should be complemented with:

- Manual testing of the user interface
- Integration tests that verify multiple components working together
- End-to-end tests that simulate real user workflows
